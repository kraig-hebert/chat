BUG FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- when user navigates backwards and forwards the active MenuIcon does not change with the page route

DIRECT-MESAGES
- use the direct message active thread to bring you direct to that thread when clicking back into direct messages from another page
    - right now it will show the right thread but the side menu options don't reflect the active thread 

FRIENDS
- figure out way to either stop the app from opening solo message when you click options icon or force the group options icon to select the group thread
- when routing to friends the active friends option does not follow the click
    - add createAsyncThunk to reducer so that you can force the multiple dispatches onClick
